This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication
# Get these from your Clerk dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_JWKS_URL=https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json

# OpenAI API Key
# Get this from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

To export these variables to your shell session, use:
```bash
# For bash/zsh - safer method that handles spaces and special characters
set -a
source .env
set +a
```

Or use the helper script:
```bash
source scripts/load-env.sh
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
